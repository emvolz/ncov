This phylogeny shows evolutionary relationships of viruses from the novel coronavirus (nCoV) outbreak. All samples are highly related with at most five mutations relative to a common ancestor, suggesting a shared common ancestor sometime in Nov 2019. This indicates an initial human infection in Nov 2019 followed by sustained human-to-human transmission leading to sampled infections.

We observe clustering of related infections. These are a cluster of two infections in Zhuhai (Guangdong/20SF028/2020 and Guangdong/20SF040/2020) and a cluster of three infections in Shenzhen (Guangdong/20SF013/2020, Guangdong/20SF025/2020, Guangdong/20SF012/2020). These are noted in GISAID as "family cluster infection". This represents clear direct human-to-human transmission.

Here, we estimate the time of the most recent common ancestor of sequenced viruses:

Site numbering and genome structure uses [BetaCoV/Wuhan-Hu-1/2019](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN908947) as reference. The phylogeny is rooted relative to early samples from Wuhan. Temporal resolution assumes a nucleotide substitution rate of 3 &times; 10^-4 subs per site per year. There were SNPs present in the nCoV samples in the first and last few bases of the alignment that were masked as likely sequencing artifacts. The sample Wuhan/IPBCAMS-WH-05/2020 has been dropped from the analysis due to the appearance of clustered, spurious SNPs.
